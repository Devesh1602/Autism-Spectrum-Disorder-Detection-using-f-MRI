# Autism Classification using fMRI Data

## Project Description
This project focuses on building an advanced machine learning framework for the classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using functional MRI (fMRI) data. The dataset includes over 6000+ ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) fMRI images, carefully labeled for this study. The core of this project is a deep learning model that utilizes a 13-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve impressive performance in detecting Autism, with a notable F1 score of 82.61% and an accuracy of 92.5%.

### Key Features:
1) Data Collection & Preprocessing: fMRI images from ABIDE were collected, labeled, and preprocessed to ensure high-quality input for the model.
2) Deep Learning Model: A 13-layer CNN architecture built using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, optimized to classify fMRI images with significant accuracy.
3) NLP-Integrated Web App: For ease of interaction, a ReactJS-based web application was developed that incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance user experience.
4) Deployment: The entire system has been deployed on Heroku, allowing easy access to the model's predictions and the web interface.

### Project Overview
This repository contains the code for classifying Autism using fMRI data. It leverages a 13-layer CNN model to analyze fMRI images and predict the likelihood of Autism. The model is integrated with a ReactJS-based web app for interactive user experiences, and it's deployed using Heroku.

We use the ABIDE fMRI dataset, consisting of 6000+ images. The data has been labeled and preprocessed to suit deep learning model requirements.

### Model
The 13-layer CNN model was designed to extract complex patterns from fMRI images. With advanced optimizations and regularization techniques, the model achieved:
F1 Score: 82.61%
Accuracy: 92.5%

### Web App
A ReactJS-based web app is integrated with the model, providing a user-friendly interface where predictions can be generated by uploading fMRI images. The web app also uses NLP to guide user interactions.

### Results
The project has demonstrated significant success in classifying Autism with high accuracy. The deployment on Heroku makes it easy to access and interact with the model predictions.
